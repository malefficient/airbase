Packet_80211_data *'s to Packet_80211 variables works correctly
and how to make sure it stays that way. (see test-airware/print for example) 
The data packet is actually a pointer. This is a cool good thing i want

Implement Packet_80211_mgmt once above question answered

Start building Crafters. 

make misc/hexstring2value do some rigorous input validiation before
calling strtoul.
